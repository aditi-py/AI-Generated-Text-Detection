# AI-Generated Text Detection ðŸ¤–

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to detect whether a text is generated by a human (ind=0) or an AI (ind=1). The dataset, obtained from [bitgrit.net](https://bitgrit.net/competition/19), spans various features, including document embeddings, word count, and punctuation. The primary challenge is to address imbalanced data and surpass the performance of a naive model or logistic regression.
